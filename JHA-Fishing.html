                <h2>How It Works</h2>
                <p>Once you call us the process is actually quite simple. We will talk to you on the phone and answer any questions that you may have. Then you will pick your dates and make your reservation.</p>


                <p>On the day of your trip we will pick you up at your hotel. If you need a fishing license or any flies or lures we will go by a shop to pick up what you need. Then it's off to the river.</p>
                <blockquote class="pull-left">"I had a great day because of your patience, experience, expertise, and friendliness." -Tyler, Virginia</blockquote>

                <p>After rigging up the rods and the boat we will hit the water. If you are new to fishing, our expert (and very patient) guides will give you all of the instruction you need. Then it's on to Catching Fish!!!</p>


                <p>Our day is spent floating down the river, fishing from the boat as well as stopping on shore to work to good holes. We have snacks and drinks on the boat, and on full day trips we stop for a delicious shore lunch.</p>

                <p>At the end of the day we will load up the truck and drive you back to your hotel, where you can rest up for the next day's adventure.</p>

                <p>Our company is small and therefore very flexible and more than happy to customize your trip to fit your needs.</p>

                                <p>Running through the heart of Jackson Hole, The Snake River is one of the crown jewels of the U.S. Wild and Scenic Rivers program.  It is a classic freestone river that is home to native Snake River Cutthroat Trout.  The scenery is spectacular and the trout are plentiful with an average of over 800 fish per mile.</p>
                                <p>The Snake is a large river and is best fished by boat.  We guide on a variety of different stretches of the Snake River, spanning over 40 miles.  Most of the sections are calm, moving water with a variety of riffles, cut banks, deep pools, and long runs.  There is also an 8 mile stretch of whitewater on the Snake that we guide on.  Fishing through the whitewater canyon is an unforgettable experience.</p>
                                <p>The Snake River is typically fishable year round, with the exception of a brief period of spring run-off which tends to occur sometime during May or June.</p>

                                <p>Brown Trout, Rainbow Trout, and Cutthroat Trout all call the Green River home.  Some of them getting up to 25-30 inches!  The Green is a small, intimate river, but still best fished by drift boat.</p>
                                <p>The season on the Green tends to be fairly short, from roughly June-August.</p>

                                <p>You can fish the Salt by either wading or floating.  The trout here tend to hide in the myriad of brushy banks, swift riffles, and deep pools.</p>

          Yellowstone National Park

                               <p>Yellowstone National Park is a huge area.  Bigger than some states.  Within it's boundaries lie a lifetime of fishing.  Nowhere else in the world will you find such an amazing mix of wildlife, geothermal features, wilderness, and adventure.  Days in Yellowstone tend to be long, tiring, and Awesome!</p>
                               <p>With the town of Jackson lying about an hour from the South Entrance to Yellowstone, we tend to focus on the waters in the southern part of the park.  The two waters we fish most often are Lewis Lake and the Firehole River.</p>
                               <h3>Lewis Lake</h3>
                               <img src="/JHA_New/images/Boat%20on%20Lewis.jpg" alt="">
                               <p>Lewis Lake is an unbelievable fishery about 1.5 hours north of Jackson.  It is home to both Brown Trout and Lake Trout.  Most of the fish we catch tend to be in the 16-22 inch range with some occasionally bigger.  We use our drift boats with small outboard motors to navigate the lake.  Focusing our fishing on flats and drop-offs, we catch fish here on a variety of nymphs and streamers and even occasionally on dries during the Brown Drake hatch.  Lewis Lake is a great option for both kids and adults, beginners and advanved anglers alike.  We typically fish Lewis Lake during June, July, and October.</p>
                               <h3>Firehole River</h3>
                               <img src="/JHA_New/images/Bison%20in%20Firehole.JPG" alt="">
                               <p>There are few fishing experiences on the planet like fishing the Firehole River.  Listed in the book "Ten Places to Fly-Fish Before you Die", and just about every other list of the top fly fishing destinations, the Firehole is truly amazing.</p>
                               <p>Leaving Jackson, you will drive North for two hours, through two National Parks, before reaching the Firehole River.  Once there, you are surrounded by Yellowstone's splendor.  Geysers erupt around you, herds of bison and elk walk by, as wade into the these sparkling waters.  If you can turn your attention away from all that, you will find plenty of Brown and Rainbow Trout to cast to.  The fish in the Firehole tend not to be overly large, but the setting is like no place on earth.</p>
                               <p>If you are looking to combine a tour of Yellowstone National Park with some great fishing, this may be the trip for you.</p>

                <h2>October 10, 2014</h2>
                <h3>Snake River</h3>
                <p>Autumn is in full swing here in Western Wyoming. The foliage is spectacular and the fishing is absolutely on fire! Right now is one of the best dry fly fishing times of year. Large Cutthroat are feeding on Mahagonies, Blue Winged Olives, and Stoneflies. Even the streamer bite is good right now. October offers some of the best fishing of the year. Come on out and enjoy it!</p>
                <h3>Green River</h3>
                <p>The Green River is very low right now. Wade fishermen will be rewarded with pre-spawn browns feeding on a variety of mayflies.</p>
                <h3>Lewis Lake</h3>
                <p>Lewis Lake fishing is picking up again now as temperatures cool. Both the Brown Trout and the Mackinaw will now start moving into the shallows to spawn.</p>
